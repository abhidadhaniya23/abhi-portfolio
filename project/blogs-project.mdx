## Introduction

I have been writing blogs for a long time now. I have tried many blogging platforms like Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, etc. But I always felt that I am not in control of my content.

I wanted to have my own blog where I can write about anything I want. I also wanted to have a platform where I can share my projects and my journey as a developer. So I decided to build my own blog.

## Content Management System

I have used Contentful as my CMS. It is a headless CMS which allows me to manage my content in a structured way. I can also use the Contentful API to fetch the content and display it on my blog.

I've already written a blog post on difference between content management systems - [Strapi vs Contentful vs Sanity](https://blogs.abhidadhaniya.com/post/powerful-content-management-systems-sanity-vs-contentful-vs-strapi)
