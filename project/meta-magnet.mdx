## Problem statement

Currently, I’m pursuing computer engineering in Vidhyanagar, Anand. In our vvn(vidhyanagar), There’s a problem for students while in search of food to eat at noon and night.

Students like me, wasting their around 1 hour deciding what to eat in food, We’ve options but still can’t decide what to eat.

> Having too many options create confusion.

### Food options

- Mug pulav (One of the famous food items in vvn)

- Gujarati dish at a fixed price

- Other fast foods

> Note: [Foodie VVN](https://www.foodievvn.com/) is a product by [Gigaweb](https://www.gigaweb.in/)

Here’s the post about Gigaweb.

## Add restaurants functions

Any user or restaurant owner can submit restaurant data and once we verify it from our admin panel, It will publicly available.

## Market survey

All lounges write daily food on board at their place. What happens if we bring those data in our foodie vvn app. It saves up to 1 hour for students.

We’ll not only list out lounges but we are including tiffin services as well. So that owners of tiffin services don’t need to share the food menu with students every day anymore.

We’ve analysed the market by visiting the restaurants in vidhyanagar and this application will be helpful for them again it’s a useful platform to publicity and list out their restaurant.
