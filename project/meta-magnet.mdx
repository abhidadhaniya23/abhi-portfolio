## Introduction

Meta Magnet is a metadata API service that provides you with the metadata of any URL. It is a free and open-source service that can be used by anyone. It is built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

## Features

- Get metadata of any URL
- Provide a server solution at affordable prices

## How to use

- Go to [Meta Magnet](https://meta-magnet.vercel.app) and enter the URL in the input field.
- To use the API, You can read the [documentation](https://meta-magnet.vercel.app/documentation)

## Purpose of this project

- To provide an affordable solutions for developers who want to use metadata in their applications
- Heroku was no longer providing free dynos for the project, so I decided to create an express.js server and host it on Vercel to test the performance of the server.

## Challenges

- The biggest challenge was to run a scheduler which would run every 24 hours to reset the limit of the API calls.
- The second challenge was to host the server on Vercel, as it was my first time hosting a server on Vercel.
- To create a middleware that would check the limit of the API calls as well as the API key is valid or not and the plan (free or pro) of the user.

## Applied solutions

- There's a package for scheduler in NodeJS called node-cron, which can be used to run a scheduler.
- But the good news for me was Supabase has a [built-in cron scheduler](https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-as-a-cron-server) which can be used to run scheduler sql queries in their built in sql editor.
- [This tool](https://crontab.guru/) is very helpful to create cron jobs scheduler time patterns.

## What I learned

- I learned how to host a server on Vercel.
- I learned how to use Supabase.
- I learned Cron scheduler to reset daily quota.
