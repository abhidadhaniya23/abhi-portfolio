## Introduction

[xLinks](https://xlinks.pro/) is a bio link generator for your social media profiles. It allows you to create a personalized profile URL and add links to your social media profiles. You can also add a profile picture and a short bio.

User authentication is done using Google OAuth. The user can create, edit, and delete their profile. The profile URL is personalized and can be accessed using xlinks.pro/username.
