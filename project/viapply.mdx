## Introduction

Viapply is a Canadian visa agency that helps you to apply for visa.

## Requirements

They wanted to create a website that would help them to get more clients and also help them to get more leads. They wanted some content control on the website so that they can update the content whenever they want.

## Applied Solution

We used NextJS for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. To full fill the content control requirements, we used [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) as a headless CMS. We also used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for the deployment.

We also created application form which is handled by firebase from backend and also used [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for the form validation.

## Result

We created a website that is fully responsive and also created a form that is fully functional. We also created a dashboard for the admin where they can update the content whenever they want.

## Client Feedback

They were very happy with the work and also they were very happy with the communication. They also said that they will work with us again in the future.
