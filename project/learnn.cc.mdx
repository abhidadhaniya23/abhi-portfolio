## Introduction

Learnn.cc is a website that provides you the best resources, freebies, and learning material on the internet. It is a website that I re-designed for my client.

Learnn.cc is maintained by [@Rahul](https://twitter.com/rahul_wip). Follow learnn.cc on twitter [@LearnnHQ](https://twitter.com/LearnnHQ)

## The problem

The client has website with a lot of resources and freebies. He wanted to make it more user friendly and easy to navigate. He also wanted to add a lot of new features to the website with a new design.

## The solution

I built a new website for the client with a new design and a lot of new features. The client has data in AirTable. So, I used AirTable API to fetch the data and display it on the website.

I implemented features like,

- Search
- Filter
- Load limited resources
- Infinite scrolling
